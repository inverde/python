# logical operators
"""
Logical operators are used to connect more than boolean expressions onto a conditional statement.

Logical operators:
1. and (Conditional statement is true if and only if both boolean expressions are true)
2. or (Conditional statement is true if either one is true or both are true)
3. not (Conditional statement is true if boolean expression is false)

In Python logical operators operates not only over boolean expressions but also over values.
When in doubt please only used operators with booleans.

Example: All positive integers are True in Python and zero is False
